# Thanakarn Icon Font - Banks in Thailand

This tool created by [Julien Vernet](https://siamkreative.com/) is based on the work from [Omise](https://github.com/omise/banks-logo).

All bank icons are trademarks of their respective owners and the use of these trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Omise, nor vice versa.
